Abstract
*********
Wlantest is an automatic wireless testing script written in Python which aims at checking 
connman behaviour.

For every test, Wlantest runs hostapd on an interface according to a config file and try
to connect to it using connman. The result is output in a text file. 


********
Install
********
Wlantest is packaged using Python disutils.

* To generate source distribution package
    python setup.py sdist

* To install from tarball
    python setup.py install

* In order to run wlantest you need the following

    hostapd >= 1.0 (optionally built with CONFIG_IEEE80211N=y)

    dhcpd (optional)

    freeradius (optional)


********************
Testing environment
********************

The minimum testing requirement is a machine with two wlan interfaces:
- An interface used in AP mode on which hostapd is running
- An interface used in STA mode that connman operates

Extra setup may be composed of:
- A radius server to test WPA-EAP
- A dhcpd to speed up connman connection process

Here is an example of our test environment:

             ---------------------- 
            |     Test Machine     |
            |        --------------|
            |       |mac80211_hwsim|
            |       |              |
            |       |       wlan0--|        --------------- 
            |       |        (STA) |       | Radius Server |
            |       |              |       |               |
            |       |       wlan1--|       |               |
            | eth0  |        (AP)  |       |     eth0      |

****************************************
Wlantest configuration test file format
****************************************

Wlantest uses configuration files to load tests. Wlantest will be looking 
for its configuration files in /etc/wlantest/. They must have a .cfg suffix.

Allowed fields:
==============
A value can either be a single item or coma-separated items.

[Description]
- description : A short description of the test.

[AP]
- ssid : A string representation of an 802.11 SSID. If this field is not present,
wlantest will use id_test as ssid.
- hidden : Must be set to true if the AP is hidden, otherwise it can be ommited.
- security : Security type, must be in {open, wpa-psk, wpa2-psk, wpa-eap, wpa2-eap}
- mode : Radio mode, must be in {a, b, g, n, gn}
- channel : Channel frequency, must be choosen accordingly to mode.
- channelposition : Channel position, must be upper or lower. It is mandatory for 40Mhz 
bandwith. If not set, 20Mhz bandwith operation.  
- method : EAP method, which is mandatory for wpa-eap or wpa2-eap security. It must be
in {PEAP, TTLS}
- phase2 : phase2 type for EAP tunneld methods, must be in {MSCHAPV2, MD5}
- identity : The identity used in EAP authentification.
- passphrase : Either quoted string if passphrase or unquoted hexadecimal if raw key
                If wep key (5, 13, or 16 characters passphrase or 10, 26, 32 digits key),
                    or wpa key (8 to 63 characters passphrase or 64 digits key),
                    or EAP password unquoted string.
Examples : "vwxyz" (wep passphrase) or 123456789a (wep key) or "12345678" (wpa passphrase)

[Connection]
- mode : The mode of connection, must be in {manual, auto}
- identity : The identity used to connect to EAP network.
- passphrase : Either wep key, wpa psk or eap password used by the agent to connect.

[Result]
- state : Expected connman state after connect attempt. Must be in {idle, ready, online}
- error : Expected connman connect error. If no error expected, must be set to None.
